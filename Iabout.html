            <p class="about">My Name is Logan Bittner. I am a sophmore at Northern Kentucky University, Majoring in Computer Information technology and minoring in Buisness Analytics. I have a passion for computers, specifically in the relm of Cybersecurity and Databases. I see myself going into the career field in one of those sectors. Outside of school, I am the President of CollegeLife, which is a campus ministry that I volunteer with. I am very passionate about ministry and my faith in general, and see it being a very big part of my life in my future. A lot of my time is taken up by Bible Studies, 1 on 1 meetings, and worship. In my free time, I love watching Formula 1, playing and watching soccer, and trying to teach myself guitar.</p>
